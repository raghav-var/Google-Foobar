    Okay so while I was showering, I realized that 
    thi s problem is better represeted as a directed 
    graph than something with dynamic programming. So 
    I googled what "determine probablity of arriving at a 
    node in a graph with loops" and it turns out this is
    a problem based on Markov chains and there are a ton
    of resources on it.
    and """
